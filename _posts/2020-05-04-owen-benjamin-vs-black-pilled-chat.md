Sensitive third-rate piano comic Owen Benjamin is devastated when he joins the Black Pilled livestream chat and finds out what people outside of his tightly controlled echo chamber really think about him. His ensuing response can only be described as perfectly normal and perfectly healthy.

In this 7 minute edited video, a flustered Owen uses the word 'like' 78 times. In the original he says it 438 times, almost *4 times a minute for two straight hours*.

From The Owen Benjamin Show Episode #781 3/23/2020.
