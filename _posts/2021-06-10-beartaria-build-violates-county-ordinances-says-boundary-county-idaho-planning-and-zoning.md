## A former comedian who raised $400,000 telling his followers that 10-acre properties in Idaho aren't subjected to ordinances is now facing a potential stop work order because his property violates... drumroll.. COUNTY ORDINANCES, according to the Bonner's Ferry Herald and other sources.

The Herald's [Victor Corral Martinez writes](https://bonnersferryherald.com/news/2021/jun/09/planning-and-zoning-issues-formal-complaint-owen-b/):  

Boundary County Planning and Zoning issued a formal complaint to Owen Benjamin last week, detailing potential land use violations for his Moyie River property. 



The June 3 letter warned that construction on the property known to Owen and his followers as Ursa Rio violates county ordinances, in part because no applications submitted to the planning department or permits issued for work on the site. 



“Boundary County has been informed that uses being developed may include, but are not limited to, cabins, residences, and RV park stalls,” planning officials said in the letter. 



The warning follows complaints by nearby residents who claimed Owen Benjamin and Struggle Bear Corporation have violated applicable zoning provisions for the neighborhood.
