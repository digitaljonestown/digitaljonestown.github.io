Another illustration of Owen Benjamin's victim mindset, gross lack of professional courtesy, and disregard for his friends:
- Owen Benjamin's comedy date at the Brea Improv got moved by the venue.
- Brea Improv informed Owen's agent, who no longer repped Owen, unbeknownst to Brea Improv.
- Paranoid Owen assumed he was blackballed for being an edgelord and blasted the Improv on Twitter and to Joe Rogan.
- Rogan stuck his neck out for Owen, threatening the Improv, saying he would make their lives hell if they blackballed Owen.
- Rogan found out the date was just moved and made Owen delete the Tweets blasting the Improv.
- 147 IQ Owen has zero clue as to how big of an asshole he is in this situation.
