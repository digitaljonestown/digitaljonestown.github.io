## Owen Benjamin fell short of his goal of having 5,000 fans pay him \$2million, but says 700 people paid â€‹\$400 or more to camp at the illegal Beartaria campgrounds 2 weeks a year. 

At [1:50](https://youtu.be/k06pOaDqkMc?t=110){:target="_blank"} he says they will "host 70 people in-house, then everyone can get two weeks a year, because 5 months of full house is 700 people."

## Yes, Owen claimed there would be 70 bears on the property at all times for 5 months a year. 

Now that neighbors are lobbying the county to shut it down and local and international media has picked up the story, Owen is backtracking from all his promises, and claiming that the compound he fundraised for is nothing more than "[10 guys barbecuing](https://youtu.be/vAhNx4tf2gM?t=1382){:target="_blank"}".
