July 29, 2020 - Owen Benjamin violates his dad's privacy by reading a recent email exchange between the two on stream. Owen justifies this by saying it's actually a way of honoring his dad by "letting his treachery be an example for other people". Owen then continues to rant about God and Satan and how his dad is every horrible thing you could possibly call a man. He also quotes a batman movie a couple times. Meanwhile Owen has nothing but good things to say about his mom, who abandoned him for a time when he was 9 years old, leaving her family not knowing if she would ever return.
