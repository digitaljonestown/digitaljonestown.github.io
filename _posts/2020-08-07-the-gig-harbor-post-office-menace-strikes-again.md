August 4th, 2020 - Backyard comedian Owen Benjamin has another crazy mask-related dust up at his local Gig Harbor, Washington Post Office. 

**Timestamps:**
5:38 Violence could erupt at any time. So me and Amy are pumped to get out of here.
7:27 Hopefully I'll get you killed.
10:15 Guy was yelling at me so I'm like *shows knife*. The cops are on my side.
11:10 I felt like I might have to fight people.
15:15 I made a lot of people think they're gonna die.
17:05 If someone would've stabbed me they would've cheered.
17:30 Fiscally that would help a lot if you would just die right now.
18:45 I was too aggressive.
20:35 This area is 99% brain dead.
21:22 Just assume they're dead. They're dead people.
