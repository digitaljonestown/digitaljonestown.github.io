The Gig Harbor Menace strikes again, as Owen Benjamin describes how he was in yet another altercation at the Post Office. This incident happened July 14, Owen is now rushing to move his family out of state, to the point of announcing he will be uprooting his family, pets, and pregnant wife (who is due to deliver any day now) to go live in a barn and/or tiny home in Idaho.

Owen has stated his reason for wanting to flee Washington so abruptly is that he doesn't want Amy's family catching any "heat", just as he moved from Saranac Lake because he didn't want his brother catching heat after offending the entire town with a cringey shock jock stunt at a family-friendly Town Hall.
