James accuses Owen of "love bombing" so we check in with special guest Dr. Todd Grande to define this new term for us. After a walk down memory lane we skip to August 19 as James responds to Owen commissioning a song about him and makes a valid argument for why Owen is the actual Luciferian. A bear sends in some good torch comedy. James has an Owen-related wager that no one will take him up on.
