This is the video referenced in a presentation to Boundary County Commissioners by concerned residents and reported on by [the Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/neighbors-fear-bear-themed-compound-will-be-next-ruby-ridge){:target="_blank"} and other news outlets recently. Owen's response has been to lie and claim he was impersonated, when in fact he was just paraphrased. At [0:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIFX-Hy5IDQ&t=18s){:target="_blank"} he says very clearly "as soon as we secure land, everyone who contributed is allowed to camp there".

Owen later [claimed](https://youtu.be/k06pOaDqkMc){:target="_blank"} only people who donated over $400 could camp, of which there were 700, so the plan is 70 bears at a time for 5 months a year.

It appears much of what Owen promised is actually illegal, according to the neighbors who are lobbying to have this all shut down.

The story was also picked up by [the Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9640211/Disgraced-alt-right-comedian-Owen-Benjamin-planning-Idaho-refuge-online-pals.html){:target="_blank"} today (6/1/2021).
