Many are wondering exactly why washed up piano comic Owen Benjamin abruptly uprooted his family, including a newborn son, to relocate to Northern Idaho right before winter. In this video, Big Bear expwains that "I've gotten enough threats where I'm like 'OK, I'm gonna live in a pwace where if I put a sign that says No Trespassing, I can f*cking use a scope. DUDE, you can use a scope'".

00:05 - Idaho has no gun laws.
01:00 - *pause, sigh, look to the side.* One of the things I love about Idaho is freedom to shoot trespassers.
01:45 - In Idaho you can kill people with barely any paperwork.
02:45 - Bear tries to pinpoint Owen's location.
03:20 - Now that I have my foreverland.
04:00 - People try to triangulate so they can swat my house.
04:20 - People don't understand the hurdles I face in my life.
04:40 - CPS came out **a bunch of times**.
05:05 - I'm tight with all the law enforcement here.
05:35 - I've gotten enough threats that I need a scope and a suppressor.
06:00 - I know all my congresspeople here.
07:04 - Taking advantage of Idaho having no gun laws, Owen is going to CONCEALED carry a six-shooter on his belt. Not for self defense, but as a fashion statement.
