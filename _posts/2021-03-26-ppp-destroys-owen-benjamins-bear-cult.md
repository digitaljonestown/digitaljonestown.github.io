Posting this to draw attention to the important work of People's Populist Press (https://www.youtube.com/user/C0mm1ssar) and the documentary The Queen Bee and The Beg Bear (https://youtu.be/rGkjQygsGlg). The must-see documentary runs 2 hours 40 minutes so I wanted to make just the parts where PPP talks about Owen readily accessible.
