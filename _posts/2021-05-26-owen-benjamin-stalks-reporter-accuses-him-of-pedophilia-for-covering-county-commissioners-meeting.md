Owen Benjamin sends his 'Bears' to the home of an Idaho newspaper editor, Mike Weland, who covered a County Commissioners meeting in which residents complained that the Beartaria cult campground is an illegal commercial enterprise. 

Weland's article is linked below and is made up almost entirely of quotes from the Commissioners meeting.

Weland would write a subsequent piece (also linked below) describing the encounter:

> On Thursday, two gentlemen came into my back yard as I was cleaning a batch of rocks I’m tumbling, camera and sound gear on. They identified themselves as Owen Benjamin’s film crew, and began telling me what a wonderful man the 40-year-old Benjamin was and questioning me about my sources for the article, asking if I was ashamed of myself for causing such a fine man and his family harm.
>
> But it wasn’t long before that line of questioning dried up.
>
> “Where’d you get that earring?” the cameraman/interviewer asked.
>
> “A friend,” I replied. It had belonged to that friend’s deceased step-father, a token of Alcoholic’s Anonymous and symbol of his fight against addiction. It was given me for encouragement after I quit drinking a few years ago after years entrapped by my own addiction.
>
> I was told, however, and with utmost certainty, that this was a symbol of pedophilia.
>
> With that, I asked both to please leave my yard and they complied.
