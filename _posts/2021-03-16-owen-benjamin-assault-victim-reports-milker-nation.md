Assault survivor/comedian Brendan Krick accuses former sitcom actor/comedian Owen Benjamin of sexual assault then tries to erase the transformative reporting on the story done by victim advocate/comedian Milker Nation. Brendan would first give the reason that he didn't want to be perceived as being part of a crusade against Big Bear, but would then report to YouTube that he felt the work was a violation of his copyright. False copyright infringement claims are very serious Brendan, maybe you should focus your energy on standing up to your supposed abuser instead of silencing fellow comedians!
